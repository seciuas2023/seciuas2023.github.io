            <h5>WELCOME TO SecIUAS 2023!</h5>

            <p class="lead">
                The SecIUAS 2023 workshop is scheduled on November 7, 2023 and will be held at Nagoya, Japan.
            </p>

            <p> SecIUAS 2023 will be co-located with 
                <a href="https://iot-conference.org/iot2023/"> the 13th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2023)</a>.</p>

            <p> We solicit high-quality position papers and research papers that address opportunities and challenges 
                in the areas of hardware security, intelligent system security, application security and network security. 
                We welcome contributions to all relevant research on attacks on IUAS, hardware protections, secure 
                software modelling and verification, security and safety analysis, network security and so on.</p>

                <p>The topics of interest include, but are by no means limited
                to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Attacks on IUAS including spoofing, eavesdropping, side-channel attack and so on</li>
                <li>Adversarial machine learning on IUAS</li>
                <li>Hardware’s vulnerabilities detection for IUAS</li>
                <li>Security protection for IUAS based on TPM (Trust Platform Model)</li>
                <li>Modelling, simulation and tools for secure and safe design of IUAS</li>
                <li>Software’s vulnerabilities detection for IUAS</li>
                <li>Automatic security and safety verification for IUAS software</li>
                <li>Efficient authentication and key management between IUASs</li>
                <li>End-to-End secure communication between IUASs</li>
                </ul>
